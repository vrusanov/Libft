# Libft

libft - recoding of some standard LibC functions

Short Introduction:
C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful standard functions. This project is about to take the time to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them. This library is useful for all the future C projects in 42 school curriculum.
